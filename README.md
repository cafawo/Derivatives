## Course materials

During the class, we will focus on the script (Jupyter Notebook) in [Derivatives/derivatives.ipynb](https://github.com/cafawo/Derivatives/blob/main/derivatives.ipynb). There are three easy peasy ways to follow along:

1. The convenient way: instead of installing Python locally on your system (e.g. because you are using an iPad), you can use [Google's Colab HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cafawo/Derivatives/blob/main/derivatives.ipynb).  (CAREFUL, there are some caveats when saving your changes, see further  [information HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb))

2. The pro way: clone this Git repository in order to **locally** follow along in Python/Jupyter. This requires a Python distribution on your local system. If you don't have one, check out [Anaconda HERE](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

3. The ancient way: use the static [HTML version HERE](https://cafawo.github.io/Derivatives/derivatives.html). This, however, will not allow you to play with the codes.
